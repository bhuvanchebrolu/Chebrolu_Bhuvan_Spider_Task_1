Disk Battle – Game Play Guide
🎯 Objective:
Connect 4 of your colored discs in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) before your opponent does.

🧩 Game Setup:
There are two players: 🔴 Red (Player 1) and 🟡 Yellow (Player 2).

Each player starts with 4 discs.

The game board is a 7x6 grid.

The game alternates between blocking and placing a disc on each turn.

🔄 Game Flow:
1. Blocking Phase:
Before placing a disc, the opponent blocks one column.

The current player cannot drop their disc into this blocked column during that turn.

If no other columns are available to block, no blocking happens.

2. Placement Phase:
The current player selects an unblocked column and drops one of their discs.

The disc falls to the lowest empty row in that column.

Each move consumes 1 disc from that player’s available count.

3. Winning Condition:
After every move, the game checks for a 4-disc sequence:

Horizontal

Vertical

Diagonal (↘️ / ↗️)

If a sequence is found, that player wins the game 🎉.

4. Draw Condition:
If neither player has discs left or the board fills up without a winner, it’s a draw 🤝.

⏱️ Timer Rules:
Each player gets 30 seconds per turn.

If the timer runs out, the opponent wins automatically.

🔁 Additional Features:
Pause/Play: Temporarily stop/resume the game.

Undo: Revert the last move (works for both blocks and placements).

Leaderboard: Tracks wins and draws using local storage.

Reset Game: Start a fresh game session.

Reset Leaderboard: Clears the win/draw history for both players.

Dark/Light Mode toggle for better visibility.
